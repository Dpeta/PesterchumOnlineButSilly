<span id="line23"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license
<span id="line24"></span>for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
<span id="line25"></span>cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line26"></span>
<span id="line27"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>The licenses for most software and other practical works are
<span id="line28"></span>designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By
<span id="line29"></span>contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your
<span id="line30"></span>freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it
<span id="line31"></span>remains free software for all its users.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line32"></span>
<span id="line33"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
<span id="line34"></span>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
<span id="line35"></span>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
<span id="line36"></span>them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<span id="line37"></span>want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<span id="line38"></span>free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line39"></span>
<span id="line40"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
<span id="line41"></span>with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
<span id="line42"></span>you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
<span id="line43"></span>and/or modify the software.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line44"></span>
<span id="line45"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
<span id="line46"></span>improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
<span id="line47"></span>receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
<span id="line48"></span>incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
<span id="line49"></span>encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
<span id="line50"></span>software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
<span id="line51"></span>The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
<span id="line52"></span>letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
<span id="line53"></span>source code to the public.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
<span id="line54"></span>
<span id="line55"></span></span><span>&lt;<span class="start-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
<span id="line56"></span>ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
<span id="line57"></span>to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
<span id="line58"></span>provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
<span id="line59"></span>users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
<span id="line60"></span>a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
<span id="line61"></span>code of the modified version.</span><span>&lt;/<span class="end-tag">p</span>&gt;</span><span>
